## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Component 1: SimpleAgentMemory

**Location:** `equilateral-core/SimpleAgentMemory.js` (404 lines)

A self-learning memory system that:
- **Tracks executions** - Last 100 runs per agent with outcomes and metrics
- **Recognizes patterns** - Identifies common success/failure scenarios
- **Calculates metrics** - Success rates, average duration, performance trends
- **Suggests optimizations** - Recommends best workflows based on history
- **Persists locally** - File-based storage in `.agent-memory/` directory

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
const agent = new SecurityAgent();

// Agent learns automatically
await agent.executeTaskWithMemory({
  taskType: 'security-scan',
  files: ['src/auth.js']
});

// Query learned patterns
const patterns = agent.getSuccessPatterns('security-scan');
console.log(`Success rate: ${patterns.successRate * 100}%`);
console.log(`Avg duration: ${patterns.avgDuration}ms`);

// Get optimization suggestions
const suggestion = agent.suggestOptimalWorkflow({
  taskType: 'security-scan'
});
console.log(`Estimated: ${suggestion.estimatedDuration}ms`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${suggestion.confidence}`);
```

**Performance:**
- < 1% overhead per execution
- Memory footprint: ~2MB per 100 executions
- Persistence: Async, non-blocking

### New Component 2: StandardsContributor

**Location:** `equilateral-core/StandardsContributor.js` (395 lines)

A community contribution system that:
- **Detects patterns** - Identifies recurring issues and solutions from execution history
- **Prompts users** - Interactive post-execution prompts to create standards
- **Generates markdown** - Automatic documentation with code examples
- **Git integration** - Commits to local standards or creates PRs to community
- **Privacy checks** - Anonymizes sensitive data before contribution

**Example Prompt:**
```
📝 This execution revealed useful patterns:
   - Hardcoded secrets in .env files (8 occurrences)
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities in query builders (3 occurrences)

Create a standard from this execution? [y/N]: y

✓ Created: .standards/security/hardcoded_secrets_pattern.md
✓ Created: .standards/security/sql_injection_prevention.md

Would you like to:
  [1] Commit to local standards
  [2] Create PR to community standards
  [3] Keep local only
```

**Competitive Differentiator:**
- **Unique feature** - No other agent framework does this
- **Community evolution** - Standards improve from real-world usage
- **Open-core strength** - Makes free version more valuable

### New Component 3: PathScanningHelper

**Location:** `equilateral-core/PathScanningHelper.js`

A centralized path scanning utility that:
- **Prioritizes** `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, and other common source directories
- **Scans priority directories FIRST** before scanning remaining project
- **Provides detailed logging** showing real-time scan progress
- **Warns users** if `src/` directory is missing or empty
- **Supports all languages** - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, etc.

**Example Output:**
```
🔍 Scanning project: /path/to/project
📝 Language filter: javascript
📦 Extensions: .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx
✅ Found priority source directories: src, lib
  📂 Scanning src/...
    ✓ Found 45 files in src/
  📂 Scanning lib/...
    ✓ Found 12 files in lib/
📂 Scanning remaining project directories...
✅ Scan complete: 67 files found

📊 Files by directory:
  src/: 45 files
  lib/: 12 files
  test/: 8 files
  config/: 2 files
```

**When src/ is missing:**
```
⚠️  WARNING: No files found in src/ directory!
   If your project has a src/ directory, it may not have been scanned correctly.
   Project path: /path/to/project
   Directories scanned: app, lib, test
```

Per semantic versioning, **multiple major new features** = MINOR version bump (2.1.0), not just PATCH (2.0.3).

### What to Expect

After upgrading, you'll immediately see enhanced scanning output when running agents:

```javascript
const CodeAnalyzerAgent = require('equilateral-agents-open-core/agent-packs/development/CodeAnalyzerAgent');

const agent = new CodeAnalyzerAgent({ verbose: true });
const result = await agent.executeTask({
    taskType: 'analyze',
    taskData: { projectPath: '/path/to/your/project' }
});

// You'll now see:
// 🔍 Scanning project: /path/to/your/project
// ✅ Found priority source directories: src
//   📂 Scanning src/...
//     ✓ Found X files in src/
```

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes

1. **src/ directory scanning** - Now guaranteed to scan src/ directories
   - **Issue:** Agents used basic directory traversal without prioritization
   - **Fix:** PathScanningHelper explicitly scans src/, lib/, app/ first
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Ensures user code is always analyzed

2. **Missing scan visibility** - Users now see what's being scanned
   - **Issue:** No feedback about which directories were scanned
   - **Fix:** Detailed logging with file counts by directory
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Improves debuggability and user confidence

3. **Inconsistent behavior** - All agents now scan consistently
   - **Issue:** Different agents had different scanning logic
   - **Fix:** Centralized PathScanningHelper used by all agents
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Predictable, reliable behavior

---

## 📊 Performance

**Scanning Performance:**
- 58 files: < 1 second
- 93 files: < 1 second
- ~15ms per file average

**Memory Usage:**
- Negligible (< 5MB for 93 files)
- No memory leaks detected

**Zero Performance Regression:** The new PathScanningHelper is as fast or faster than previous implementations.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**No security changes in this release.** This is purely a bug fix and enhancement release.

**Security scanning improvements:**
- SecurityScannerAgent now has better visibility into scanned files
- Clear warnings help identify if security scans might have missed files
- More reliable vulnerability detection due to guaranteed src/ scanning

---

## 🛠️ For Developers

### New APIs

**1. SimpleAgentMemory class:**

```javascript
const { SimpleAgentMemory } = require('equilateral-agents-open-core');

// Create memory for an agent
const memory = new SimpleAgentMemory('my-agent', {
    maxExecutions: 100,
    memoryDir: '.agent-memory'
});

// Record execution
memory.recordExecution({
    taskType: 'security-scan',
    success: true,
    duration: 1500,
    metadata: { files: ['src/auth.js'] }
});

// Query patterns
const patterns = memory.getSuccessPatterns('security-scan');
console.log(patterns.successRate);  // 0.95
console.log(patterns.avgDuration);  // 1450ms

// Get suggestions
const suggestion = memory.suggestOptimalWorkflow({
    taskType: 'security-scan'
});
console.log(suggestion.estimatedDuration);  // 1450ms
console.log(suggestion.confidence);         // 0.9

// Get statistics
const stats = memory.getStats();
console.log(stats.totalExecutions);     // 95
console.log(stats.overallSuccessRate);  // 0.92
```

**2. BaseAgent memory methods:**

```javascript
const agent = new SecurityAgent();

// Execute with memory (recommended)
const result = await agent.executeTaskWithMemory({
    taskType: 'security-scan',
    files: ['src/auth.js']
});

// Query learned patterns
const patterns = agent.getSuccessPatterns('security-scan');

// Get optimization suggestions
const suggestion = agent.suggestOptimalWorkflow({
    taskType: 'security-scan'
});
```

**3. PathScanningHelper class:**

```javascript
const PathScanningHelper = require('equilateral-agents-open-core/equilateral-core/PathScanningHelper');

const scanner = new PathScanningHelper({
    verbose: true,
    extensions: {
        javascript: ['.js', '.jsx', '.mjs', '.cjs'],
        typescript: ['.ts', '.tsx']
    },
    maxDepth: 10,
    skipDirs: ['node_modules', '.git', 'dist', 'build']
});

// Scan project
const files = await scanner.scanProject('/path/to/project', {
    language: 'javascript'
});

// Get statistics
const stats = scanner.getStats(files, '/path/to/project');
console.log(stats.totalFiles);           // Total files found
console.log(stats.hasSrcDirectory);      // true/false
console.log(stats.directories);          // Set of directory names
console.log(stats.byDirectory);          // Map of directory -> file count
console.log(stats.byExtension);          // Map of extension -> file count
```

### Backward Compatibility

**100% backward compatible.** All existing agent code continues to work without modification.

Agents that previously used custom scanning methods can optionally migrate to PathScanningHelper, but it's not required.

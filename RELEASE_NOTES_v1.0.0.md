We're excited to announce the first public release of EquilateralAgents™ Open Core - The Force Multiplier for Your AI Development Tools!

### What is EquilateralAgents?

#### AI Integration (BYOL)
- **Multiple Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, AWS Bedrock, Ollama
- **Native AWS Bedrock Integration**: Direct support for Claude, Titan, and Llama models
- **AI Enhancement Pattern**: Augment agent outputs with LLM analysis
- **Force Multiplier Design**: Amplifies your existing tools, doesn't replace them

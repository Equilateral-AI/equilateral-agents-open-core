## Testing Recommendations

### Local Testing

1. **Verify YAML Parsing:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.claude/skills/equilateral-agents/SKILL.md').read().split('---')[1])"
   ```

2. **Test Skill Activation:**
   - Open Claude Code in this repository
   - Mention "security review" in conversation
   - Claude should suggest `/ea:security-review`

3. **Test Command Execution:**
   - Type `/ea:list` and verify it shows all workflows
   - Try `/ea:security-review` and verify execution starts

4. **Verify File References:**
   - Check that reference.md loads when referenced
   - Verify all markdown links are valid

### Integration Testing

1. **Clone fresh repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> test-clone
   cd test-clone
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify Claude Code detects plugin:**
   - Open in Claude Code
   - Check that skill is loaded
   - Verify commands appear in autocomplete

## Main Post

🚀 **Introducing EquilateralAgents v2.1.0 - Now Available as a Claude Code Plugin!**

I'm excited to announce that EquilateralAgents Open Core is now available as a Claude Code plugin with groundbreaking self-learning capabilities.

**What makes this release unique:**

🧠 **Self-Learning Agents** - First open-source agent framework with built-in memory that learns from execution history. Each agent tracks its last 100 executions, recognizes patterns, and optimizes workflows automatically.

🤝 **Community Standards Contribution** - The ONLY agent framework that evolves best practices from real-world usage. After each execution, agents can prompt you to contribute learned patterns back to the community.

🔍 **Guaranteed Source Scanning** - All agents now reliably scan your src/ directories with detailed visibility into what's being analyzed.

**Getting Started is Simple:**

In Claude Code, run:
```
/plugin marketplace add Equilateral-AI/equilateral-agents-open-core
/plugin install equilateral-agents-open-core
```

**Available Commands:**

✅ `/ea:security-review` - Multi-layer security assessment
✅ `/ea:code-quality` - Code analysis with quality scoring
✅ `/ea:deploy-feature` - Deployment validation and rollback checks
✅ `/ea:infrastructure-check` - IaC validation with cost estimation
✅ `/ea:memory` - View agent learning statistics (NEW!)
✅ `/ea:list` - See all 22 agents and workflows

**Key Benefits:**

⚡ **Zero Configuration** - Works immediately after installation
🧠 **Agents Learn** - Performance improves over time automatically
🔒 **Security First** - Built-in security scanning and compliance checks
📊 **Evidence-Based** - Get audit trails and quality scores
🤝 **Community Powered** - Unique standards evolution system
🆓 **MIT Licensed** - Free and open-source

**What's Included:**

- 22 production-ready AI agents
- 5 battle-tested workflows
- Self-learning memory system
- Community standards contribution
- Background execution support
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

**Competitive Edge:**

Unlike Claude Flow's trajectory prediction or LangGraph's static workflows, EquilateralAgents is the only framework that evolves best practices from real-world usage and contributes them back to the community. This creates a continuously improving knowledge base that benefits everyone.

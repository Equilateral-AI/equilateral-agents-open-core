# EquilateralAgents Open-Core v2.1.0 - Agent Memory Release

**Release Date**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: Self-Learning Agents with Community Standards Contribution

---

## 🎯 What We Built

Added **self-learning capabilities** to all agents with a unique **community standards contribution** system that evolves `.equilateral-standards` from real-world usage patterns.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Self-Learning Agent Memory

**Every agent now learns from execution history:**
- ✅ Tracks last 100 executions automatically
- ✅ Identifies success/failure patterns
- ✅ Suggests optimal workflows based on experience
- ✅ Calculates performance metrics and trends
- ✅ Improves over time with each execution

**Example:**
```javascript
const agent = new SecurityAgent();

// Agent learns automatically
await agent.executeTaskWithMemory({
  taskType: 'security-scan',
  files: ['src/auth.js']
});

// Query learned patterns
const patterns = agent.getSuccessPatterns('security-scan');
console.log(`Success rate: ${patterns.successRate}`);

// Get suggestions
const suggestion = agent.suggestOptimalWorkflow({
  taskType: 'security-scan'
});
console.log(`Estimated duration: ${suggestion.estimatedDuration}ms`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${suggestion.confidence}`);
```

### 2. Community Standards Contribution

**Unique feature: Patterns evolve into standards**

After workflow execution, agents can prompt users to contribute learned patterns back to `.equilateral-standards`:

```bash
$ node orchestrator.js security-review

Running security-review workflow...
✓ Scanned 50 files
✓ Found 12 issues

📝 This execution revealed useful patterns:
   - Hardcoded secrets in .env files (8 occurrences)
   - SQL injection in query builders (3 occurrences)

Create a standard from this execution? [y/N]: y

✓ Created: .standards/security/hardcoded_secrets_pattern.md
✓ Created: .standards/security/sql_injection_prevention.md

Would you like to:
  [1] Commit to local standards
  [2] Create PR to community standards
  [3] Keep local only

Choice [3]: 1

✓ Standards committed locally
```

**Generated standards include:**
- Problem description
- Pattern identification
- Solution with code examples
- Evidence from real usage
- Related standards cross-references

### 3. Integration with .equilateral-standards

Standards evolve from community usage:

```
User executes workflow
    ↓
Agent discovers patterns
    ↓
System prompts for contribution
    ↓
Standards generated automatically
    ↓
Community standards improve
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run the Demo

```bash
npm run demo:memory
```

This demonstrates:
- Agent learning over 25 executions
- Pattern recognition
- Workflow suggestions
- Performance improvement tracking
- Memory export/backup

### Use in Your Agents

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
```javascript
class MyAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async executeTask(task) {
    // Your logic here
    return { result: 'success' };
  }
}

const agent = new MyAgent();
await agent.executeTaskWithMemory(task);
// Memory recorded automatically
```

**Option 2: Manual Control**
```javascript
class MyAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async executeTask(task) {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    try {
      const result = await this.doWork(task);

      this.recordExecution(task, {
        success: true,
        duration: Date.now() - startTime,
        result
      });

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.recordExecution(task, {
        success: false,
        duration: Date.now() - startTime,
        error: error.message
      });
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### View Memory Stats

```bash
# View all agent memory stats
npm run memory:stats

# Or programmatically
const stats = agent.getMemoryStats();
console.log(stats);
```

### Disable Memory (if needed)

```javascript
const agent = new MyAgent({
  enableMemory: false  // Opt-out
});
```

## 🎯 Competitive Positioning

### vs Claude Flow v2.7.4

**Claude Flow Has:**
- Semantic search (150x faster)
- Confidence scoring
- Trajectory prediction
- Training epochs

**We Have:**
- ✅ Basic pattern recognition (simpler, but sufficient)
- ✅ **Community standards contribution** (unique!)
- ✅ **Standards evolution from real usage** (unique!)
- ✅ Integration with `.equilateral-standards` (unique!)

**Our Differentiator**: Not just individual learning, but **community knowledge evolution**.

### Open-Core vs Enterprise

- ~50 KB per agent (100 executions)
- 22 agents = ~1.1 MB total
- Minimal performance impact (<1%)

**Execution Overhead:**
- Recording: ~1-2ms
- Pattern analysis: ~5-10ms
- Total: <1% of typical workflow time

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What's Stored in Memory

✅ **Safe:**
